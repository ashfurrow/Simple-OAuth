Simple-OAuth
============

Just so we get one thing straight: I didn't write any of these. I may have modified them, but they're all works done by the respective owners, so check the headers and thank those developers.

Simple OAuth isn't hard to use, but I'm too busy to write about how to use it yet, so I'm going to go write a Tumblr API wrapper and I'll come back here and use that as example code.
